SITE is a simple point model that uses an integration interval (dt) of one hour, based mostly on previously developed, but more complex, models, especially LSX, LSM and IBIS. The model is structured with a canopy layer and two soil layers, where the first layer is close to the soil surface and the second reaches 3.5 m depth. SITE is a dynamic model that incorporates nine processes: infrared radiation balance in the canopy, balance of solar radiation, aerodynamic processes, plant physiology, transpiration, balance of water intercepted by the canopy, transport of mass and energy fluxes, soil heat flux, soil moisture and carbon balance. The SITE model is used to estimate the fluxes of CO2, water and energy, is forced with hourly weather observed data (air temperature, radiation balance, precipitation, humidity, and wind speed).
